# Recursion Practice in C++ and java

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs that solve problems using recursion.  
Each file demonstrates a unique recursive technique to break problems down into smaller steps.

## 🚀 What's Inside
- Basic recursion functions
- Classic mathematical recursion
- String and array recursion
- Practice problems for beginners to intermediate

## 📂 Structure
Recursion-Practice/
├─ factorial.cpp
└─ more coming soon...


## 🎯 Goals
- Improve recursive thinking
- Understand base case & recursive case
- Prepare for coding interviews and DSA

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Any java compiler for java files
- Any C++ compiler (g++, MinGW, Dev-C++, VS Code, etc.)

## ▶️ How to Run

 factorial.cpp -o run
./run
## ⭐ Contributions
- More problems will be added continuously.
